<Base title="About — Ian Hogers" side="neutral">
  <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl mb-8">About</h1>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>I'm Ian — also known as <strong>SanCoca</strong> online. Dutch-Australian software engineer and game developer based in the real world, building things that work.</p>
    <p>I've been writing code since I was a kid and never really stopped. I build websites, games, tools, and whatever else needs building. If there's a problem, I solve it. If there's a thing that should exist, I make it.</p>

    <h2>The two sides</h2>
    <p>This site has two halves because I do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="text-purple-300">Dev</strong> — software engineering, AI agents, game development, technical deep-dives. The stuff that pays the bills and keeps the brain sharp.</li>
      <li><strong class="text-amber-400">Life</strong> — cooking, baking, bunny rescue, voice acting, crafts, and whatever else I'm into. The stuff that keeps me human.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Same person, different modes. Pick your side, or read both. I don't judge.</p>

    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <p>Direct. No-nonsense. I'd rather ship something good today than talk about shipping something perfect next quarter. If you want meetings about meetings, I'm the wrong person. If you want stuff done — let's go.</p>

    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    <p>Find me online as <strong>SanCoca</strong> or reach out at <a href="mailto:ian@ianhogers.com">ian@ianhogers.com</a>.</p>
