        <p>The <strong class="text-green-400">Bambooboys</strong> were a guild on <strong>MapleLegends</strong>, a MapleStory private server. This was around 2015 - good times, good people, a lot of grinding and hanging out.</p>

        <p>I streamed back then too. Would love to find those old clips someday.</p>

        <h2 class="text-green-400">The crew</h2>
        <p>Some of the people I remember (this page is a living document - I'll add more as memory serves):</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inviper</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Kenneth</strong></li>
          <li><strong>vincentmango</strong></li>
          <li><strong>ice pack</strong></li>
          <li><em>...and more. If you were in Bambooboys and you're reading this, reach out!</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-green-400">What we did</h2>
        <p>The usual MapleStory things - bossing, grinding, chilling in Henesys. But the guild was more than that. It was a community. One of those online groups that just clicked.</p>

        <p>If you have screenshots, clips, or memories from this era - I'd love to hear from you.</p>
