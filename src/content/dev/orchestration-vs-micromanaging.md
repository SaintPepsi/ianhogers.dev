I used to have three tabs open. One agent writing code. Another running tests. A third doing... something. I'd lost track because I'd been jumping between them for twenty minutes trying to figure out what each one decided.

That's not orchestrating. That's babysitting.

## What changed

I stopped managing agents and started talking to an orchestrator. The difference is everything.

Now I just say what I'm thinking. "Fix the border clipping on the website." "Add those library skills." "Write an article about this." I don't care which agent picks it up, which files need changing, or what order things happen in. I dump the thought, and it gets routed to wherever it needs to go.

It's like having a conversation with someone who actually listens and then goes and does the work. I don't have to context-switch. I don't have to remember which tab has which task. I just keep talking.

## The relief is real

The anxiety I had before came from bandwidth. My brain trying to be the router. Figuring out which project needs attention, which agent is stuck, which context window is bloated. All while trying to actually think about the work itself.

That's gone now. I sit in one conversation. I throw thoughts at it as they come. Website needs a fix? Said it. Token usage feels high? Asked about it. New article idea? Mentioned it. Cursor behaving weird on mobile? Brought it up mid-conversation.

All different projects. All different concerns. One stream of consciousness. The orchestrator figures out the rest.

## Why it works

When you're the router, every task has overhead. Open the right project. Find the right file. Remember what you were doing last time. Frame the prompt correctly. That overhead kills momentum.

When the orchestrator is the router, you just think out loud. The context is already there because you've been talking about it. The orchestrator knows which codebase you mean. It knows what you tried before. It picks up where things left off.

You stop managing and start thinking. That's the shift.

## The old way was exhausting

Three tabs. Four terminals. Slack open. Docs open. Every context switch costs you minutes of re-loading your own mental state. And for what? To manually do what a good orchestrator does automatically.

The worst part was the guilt. If I wasn't actively checking on an agent, I felt like I was dropping the ball. So I'd hover. Check outputs. Re-read context. Burn tokens and burn myself out doing it.

That's not productivity. That's anxiety wearing a productivity mask.

## Just talk

The best orchestration doesn't feel like orchestration. It feels like a conversation. You say what's on your mind, and things happen. You review results when they're ready. You course-correct when needed. But you're not juggling.

I went from managing agents to just... talking. About my website, my tools, my ideas, whatever's on my mind. And somehow all of it gets done.

That's what good orchestration actually is. Not control. Relief.
