Three tabs open. One agent writing code. Another running tests. A third doing... something. You've lost track because you've been jumping between them for twenty minutes trying to figure out what each one decided.

You're not orchestrating. You're babysitting.

## The bandwidth problem

Human brains are terrible at multiplexing. We think we can manage four agents at once. What actually happens is we context-switch between them, lose track of decisions, and panic when something looks wrong.

Then the anxiety kicks in. You start hovering. Checking every output. Re-reading context you already read. The AI is supposed to save you time but now you're spending all your time watching the AI.

## Agents don't go wrong mid-task

When an agent makes a bad call, it's almost always because you weren't explicit enough at the start. Not because you weren't watching closely enough during.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

"Implement the new feature" gives the agent room to guess. "Add a `currency` field to the `Order` model, update the serializer, add a test — here are the three files" gives it rails.

The agent doesn't need you watching. It needs you to be precise before you walk away.

## The actual work is upfront

Scope tightly. Exact files, exact goals, exact constraints. Five minutes writing a clear task saves thirty minutes of cleanup.

Set limits. "You have 3 attempts to fix failing tests. Stop and report after that." Without this, agents loop forever and burn tokens doing it.

Isolate. One agent, one task, one context. Don't shove three unrelated things into the same session.

Then trust the output. Review the result, not the process. You don't need to watch every step.

## The tab-switching trap

Every time you switch tabs to check on an agent mid-task, you're breaking your own focus, burning tokens reading partial context, and gaining nothing. It's not done yet. There's nothing actionable.

But it feels productive. That's the trap. It feels like you're managing things. You're not. You're just anxious.

## So stop

Write a clear task. Hand it off. Go do something else. Review when it's done.

That's orchestration. Everything else is anxiety wearing a productivity mask.

Close the tab.
