Here's a rundown of things I've built, contributed to, or just couldn't stop tinkering with.

## Katana

![Svelte + Tauri](/assets/from-old-site/software-1.webp)

The big one. Katana is a website builder I built from scratch. My own site runs on it. Built with Svelte and Tauri, it's fast, lightweight, and does exactly what I need. No bloat, no nonsense.

## SpacetimeDB Runes Package

A Svelte package for working with SpacetimeDB. Reactive, clean, and built to make real-time database stuff feel natural in Svelte apps.

## Anti Spiral Interactive

![GDevelop](/assets/from-old-site/software-3.webp)

Game dev work under the Anti Spiral Interactive banner. Building games, experimenting with engines, and having a good time doing it.

## Svelte Writable With

![Svelte](/assets/from-old-site/software-5.webp)

A utility package that extends Svelte's writable stores with extra functionality. Small, focused, useful.

## Svelte Dialog Modal

A dialog/modal component for Svelte. Accessible, simple to use, and doesn't try to do too much. Just a good modal.

## Aggressive Proximity Patterns

![GitHub](/assets/from-old-site/software-4.webp)

An article diving into aggressive proximity patterns in software. The kind of thing that makes you rethink how you structure your code.

More stuff in the works. Always building something.
