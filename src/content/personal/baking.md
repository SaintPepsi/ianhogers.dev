I bake. A lot. And people keep coming back for more, so I must be doing something right.

## Cinnamon Scrolls

Fresh, fluffy, absolutely loaded with icing. These are the kind that fill the whole house with that smell and make everyone suddenly appear in the kitchen. Soft on the inside, slightly golden on the outside. Perfect with coffee or just on their own.

## Dutch Danish

This is the one. Apple, cinnamon, raisins, almond, topped with lemon icing. Braided, golden, and honestly dangerous. Once you start, you can't stop. It's a family thing - Dutch roots run deep in the pastry department.

## Pepernoten

Spiced, crunchy, irresistible little button-sized biscuits. A Dutch classic. I make batches of these and they vanish in hours. Every single time.
