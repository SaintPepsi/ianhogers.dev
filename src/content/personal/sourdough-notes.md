The internet has made sourdough way harder than it needs to be. You don't need a $200 banneton, you don't need to feed your starter at exactly 4-hour intervals, and you definitely don't need to name it.

## The basics

1. Flour + water + time = starter
2. Starter + more flour + more water + salt = dough
3. Wait. Fold a few times. Wait more. Shape. Wait again. Bake.

That's literally it.

## What actually matters

- **Flour quality** — Use decent bread flour. This is the one thing worth spending on.
- **Time and temperature** — Warmer = faster. Cooler = slower, more flavour. Your fridge is your best tool.
- **Don't overwork it** — A few stretch-and-folds, not a workout.

## What doesn't matter

- The exact hydration percentage (within reason)
- Whether you use a Dutch oven or a baking stone (both work)
- What your Instagram feed says the crumb should look like

Make bread. Eat bread. Adjust next time. Done.
